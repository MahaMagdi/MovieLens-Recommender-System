End-to-End recommendation system for the 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐋𝐞𝐧𝐬(small) dataset! 🎬

Built with Dash, our interactive dashboard includes:

- 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞👥:

Personal History: View movie-watching history.

Custom Recommendations: Choose the number of recommendations, and see posters of top-rated movies similar to their history.

- 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞🍿📽️:

Title-Based Recommendations: Select a movie title to get recommendations based on ratings or similar genres.
